## Hi there 👋

🎨👨‍💻 Motion designer with a developer mindset. I mix visuals, code, and sound to build creative digital stuff.
Skilled in HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Angular – with a soft spot for animation and interactivity.
Also using Adobe Suite, Blender, and AI tools to bring things to life.

🧠 Currently exploring the overlap between design, frontend, and creative coding.
